                    <p>The German-born physicist Albert Einstein developed the first of his groundbreaking theories while working as a clerk in the Swiss patent office in Bern. After making his name with four scientific articles published in 1905, he went on to win worldwide fame for his general theory of relativity and a Nobel Prize in 1921 for his explanation of the phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect. An outspoken pacifist who was publicly identified with the Zionist movement, Einstein emigrated from Germany to the United States when the Nazis took power before World War II. He lived and worked in Princeton, New Jersey, for the remainder of his life.</p>

                    <p>     Mother Teresa (1910–1997) was a Roman Catholic nun who devoted her life to serving the poor and destitute around the world. She spent many years in Calcutta, India where she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation devoted to helping those in great need. In 1979, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and became a symbol of charitable, selfless work. In 2016, Mother Teresa was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Teresa.

                            “It is not how much we do,
                            but how much love we put in the doing.
                            It is not how much we give,
                            but how much love we put in the giving.”</p>

                            Situated at the northwest corner of the North American continent, Alaska is separated by Canadian territory from the coterminous 48 states. Alaska is the largest of the 50 states, with a total area of 591,004 sq mi (1,530,699 sq km). Land takes up 570,833 sq mi (1,478,456 sq km) and inland water, 20,171 sq mi (52,243 sq km). Alaska is more than twice the size of Texas, the next largest state, and occupies 16% of the total US land area; the e-w extension is 2,261 mi (3,639 km); the maximum n-s extension is 1,420 mi (2,285 km).</p>

                    <h3>Hawaii</h3>
                   <center> <img src="images/hawaii-2.jpg" width=700 height=400/></center>
                    <p>Hawaii (Hawaiʻi) – almost always called the Big Island to avoid confusion – is the largest of the islands and home to Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa (the largest and one of the most active volcanoes on Earth), Hawaii Volcanoes National Park [2], coffee and macadamia nut plantations, working ranches, and even green sand beaches. Kailua-Kona is the busiest part of the island on the dry, leeward side, and near the mega-resort Kohala Coast area with nearly zero annual precipitation. The saddle road (quite passable and a must see--despite what rental car companies say) passes between the massive volcanoes and connects Kohala with Hilo, the largest town on the windward side with annual precipitation of more than 300 inches per year. Unlike anywhere else on Earth and definitely worth a look.</p>

                            <h3>South Indian Cuisine</h3>
                            <center><img src="images/best-south-indian-food-wedding-lunch.jpg" width=700 height=400/></center>
                           <p>The Base is Rice: Almost all the South Indian dishes are prepared with Rice as the base ingredient. The Rice is cooked at different temperatures, depending on the food item and blended with a variety of spices to form the various delicacies.
                                Five States: South Indian food is the staple food of 5 states in India. The people of  Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and the state of Telengana, consume more South Indian food than the rest of India, combined.
                                Taste Meter: Most people have a common notion, that South Indian food is all cooked in a similar way everywhere. This, however is an extremely wrong perception as each of the 5 states, offer you a different taste. Similar dishes are cooked with a different blend of spices and the taste can vary from fairly mild to very spicy, depending on the place.
                                Beyond Dosas and Idlis: South Indian food as we all think is pretty much Dosas and Idlis. But it way beyond that and there a few popular South Indian dishes, that you wouldn’t have even heard of, before. The State of Andhra has Pesarattu (kind of a pancake), Upma and Pulihaara (tamarind and rice). Karnataka South Indian Food is pretty unique and you will be surprised to know, that to boost the taste, they use sweeteners such as Jaggery and Palm Sugar.
                                Coconut for Chutneys: The main ingredient used in a variety of South Indian cuisine chutneys, is coconut.  Coconut is again used a lot, while preparing dishes in Kerela. The primary reason for Kerela using coconut as base is because Kerela is the top exporter of Coconut in India and it is found in abundance across the state.</p>
                            <h3>Mexican Cuisine</h3>
                            <center><img src="images/Four-Burritos.jpg" width=700 height=400/></center>
                            <p>Mexican cuisine is as complex as other ancient cuisines, such as those of China and Japan, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history.[4] It is created mostly with ingredients native to Mexico, as well as those brought over by the Spanish conquistadors, with some new influences since then.[5] In addition to staples, such as corn and chile peppers, native ingredients include tomatoes, squashes, avocados, cocoa and vanilla,[3] as well as ingredients not generally used in other cuisines, such as edible flowers, vegetables like huauzontle and papaloquelite, or small criollo avocados, whose skin is edible.[6]

                                    Vegetables play an important role in Mexican cuisine. Common vegetables include zucchini, cauliflower, corn, potatoes, spinach, swiss chard, mushrooms, jitomate (red tomato), green tomato, etc. Other traditional vegetable ingredients include chiles, huitlacoche (corn fungus), huauzontle, and nopal (cactus leaves) to name a few.
                                    
                                    European contributions include pork, chicken, beef, cheese, herbs and spices, as well as some fruits.
                                    
                                    Tropical fruits, many of which are indigenous to Mexico and the Americas, such as guava, prickly pear, sapote, mangoes, bananas, pineapple and cherimoya (custard apple) are popular, especially in the center and south of the country.[7]</p>
